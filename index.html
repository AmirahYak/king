<h1>intresing facts about ragdoll kittens</h1>
<p>This adorable breed is about as docile as cats come. In fact, the name "ragdoll" comes from their tendency to go limp when picked up. These cats love to be held and babied and will relax in your arms for as long as you'll let them.
 How to Pick Up and Hold a Cat the Right Way
The ragdoll's personality is smart, gentle, and super affectionate kind kitties love and crave human attention, but they're rarely demanding. Ragdolls are extremely loyal and devoted to their people, making them wonderful companion pets.
But Kirsten Kranz, director of Specialty Purebred Cat Rescue, says that while these "gentle, floppy cats" are typically laid-back, every cat is an individual and it's important to do your due diligence before bringing home a kitten, no matter the breed.
"It is exceptionally important that potential owners do their homework, get references, and interact with breeders' cats before taking the plunge," she says.

<p>Snakes are thought to have evolved from terrestrial lizards as early as the Middle Jurassic Epoch (174.1 million to 163.5 million years ago). The oldest known fossil snake, Eophis underwoodi, was a small snake that lived in southern England about 167 million years ago.
Snakes also slowly evolved, and no longer have legs because they developed other ways to move. Millions of years ago the ancestors of snakes were lizards, part of a group of animals called reptiles. Over time, these lizards began moving differently, depending less on their legs.
Small and worm-like burrowing snakes known as scolecophidians have been considered the most primitive living snakes of today and are supposed to have lived among the first ancestors of snakes. Many hypotheses believe that snakes evolved from a burrowing lizard ancestor that was blind.
One stormy day 67 million years ago, the 11.5-foot (3.5 meter) snake apparently slithered into the unguarded dinosaur nest. The snake had spotted a 1.6-foot-long (half-meter-long) dinosaur struggling out of its eggshell, scientists speculate.
Ever since Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden, snakes in Christian tradition have been associated with lies, evil and temptation. But in other cultures, as far-flung as ancient Greece and Egypt and indigenous North America, snakes symbolize fertility, rebirth, renewal and even immortality.</p>
